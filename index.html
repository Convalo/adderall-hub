<h2><strong>ONE OF THE EASIEST DRUGS TO GET IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/adderall-uses-abuses">Adderall</a> hub is much closer than you imagine.</p>
<p>After all, you wouldn&rsquo;t think that a tree-lined suburban street with picket fences and nice two-story home, is a hot bed of prescription drug dealing and use. No, you couldn&rsquo;t imagine that among the streets of your neighborhood, transactions worthy of a DEA takedown are occurring. </p>
<p>Worse yet, the sale of those prescription drugs such as Adderall, could be originating or concluding from within a home much like your own.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/things-must-tell-kids-drugs">your kids</a> might be involved in this process, either as a seller or user. And if the legalities and moral discretions don&rsquo;t get you, just to know your child is either a pusher or an addict will.</p>
<h2><strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</strong></h2>
<p>Look to yourself, as well as to your own <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/safely-dispose-prescription-drugs">medicine cabinet</a>. If you use prescription painkillers, or attention disorder medication such as Adderall, take stock of your supply. Take note of the type of drugs you have, and their amount.</p>
<p>With that baseline, keep track over your medications to see if any of them beyond your own use are missing.</p>
<h2><strong>SHOULD SOMETHING BE MISSING, HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH IT?</strong></h2>
<p>Whether it&rsquo;s Adderall or another type of medication missing from your medicine cabinet, rather than worrying about whether or not you&rsquo;ll offend them, you&rsquo;re better off asking your kids directly if they might know something about your medications.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s better to question them immediately, and if your kids have stolen your medication for their own uses, try to counsel them on not just the dangers of using the drugs, but the criminality of their actions. No, this isn&rsquo;t easy pickings here. There are real consequences involved.</p>
<p>Remember, in the Adderall hub, time is of the essence. The sooner you address the problem of stealing, using or selling your prescription medication, the better off your kids will be for having a correspondence with you that yes, while tough love in principle, it should nonetheless discourage behavior like this in the future. </p>
